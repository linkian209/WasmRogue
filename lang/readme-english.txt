NOTE:

If you got this program from an archive or web page, check for a newer version:
     http://calcrogue.jimrandomh.org
CalcRogue is constantly in development with new features being added and bugs
being fixed. You will miss out on a lot by running an older version.


INSTALLATION

- Choose the directory which corresponds to your system or calculator type (eg binTI89 for a TI-89 calculator, binWin for a Windows computer).
- Choose the directory which corresponds to your preferred language
- Copy all of the files in that directory to your calculator
- ARCHIVE EVERYTHING! You need most of your memory free when running CalcRogue.


CONTROLS

After a game is started, press APPs for a menu of keys and their functions.
Navigate menus using the arrows and enter. The first time you play, you should
also run through the tutorial, which introduces the controls as well as many
of the game concepts. Also, during a game you can press F1 for help.


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Thanks to Thomas Navara, who did the Czech translation. His quick translating
work made translating into many languages go smoothly. Thanks to the developers
of NetHack, ADOM, Angband, and Crawl, and to rec.games.roguelike.development,
for their wealth of ideas. Finally, thanks to all my users who submitted bug
reports, without which CalcRogue would be much buggier than it is today.
