# WasmRogue
This is an effort to compile a beloved game from my high school time to web assembly so I can play it on my phone.

# Old README
First, run the 'configure' script. This requires that you have a Unix-like
environment, preferrably either Linux or Cygwin. You will also need m4, a C
compiler and a C++ compiler.

Then, run either:
  make all         (compile everything you can)
  make computer    (compile for the native system only)
  make ti89        (compile for only the TI-89)
  make ti92p       (compile for only the TI-92+)
  make palm        (compile for only PalmOS)
  make clean       (remove intermediate files)
  make tidy        (remove intermediate and output files)
  make distclean   (remove intermediate files and configure settings)

If you are using Windows you will need Cygwin, which can be obtained from
http://www.cygwin.com/.

To compile you will need m4. This should be available as a package for
Cygwin/your distro; if not, get it from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/m4/.

To compile for TI calculators you will also need TIGCC (http://tigcc.ticalc.org)
To compile for PalmOS you will need PRC-Tools (http://prc-tools.sourceforge.net)

TIGCC can be obtained from http://tigcc.ticalc.org/. Note that you should use
only the very most recent version of TIGCC with CalcRogue; older versions may
not work, and have had bugs which affect CalcRogue.

SGT (Static GetText) is now included in the CalcRogue source, so it does not
need to be downloaded separately. The functions of ttbin2oth and par are now
handled by the included CLuSS compiler, so they are not required. If you
do not have TIGCC, you can still compile, just not for TI calculators. If you
do not have PRC-Tools, you can still compile, just not for PalmOS.
