Namespace pollution: LANGUAGE is taken up with some depracated crap, when
  I want to use it for *real* localization.
size_t not defined my palmOS.h for some reason
FILE not defined by palmOS.h
Missing functions: clrscr, time, free, strcpy, memset, min, max, memcpy, fopen, fclose, remove, fread, fwrite, strlen, strcat
Analogous functions available for strcpy, memset, strlen, strcat
MemMove analogous to memcpy, but with the wrong damn return type. WTF?
prctools' headers are the most pathetic thing I've seen in a while. Not bothering, making my own wrapper macros.

In unix_stdarg.h, va_arg is broken. Hopefully vsprintf isn't using it (yeah, right).
In unix_string.h: memcpy does triple-evaluation on its first arguments. Worse than no macro at all!
And the ONLY prototype of calloc in the ENTIRE api is in the freaking SOCKET library!
Where the hell is vsscanf? Or for that matter, vcbprintf, or vsnprintf or anything which could be used to build something interesting?

Include path: huffman.c -> SDK 5r3 -> include/keyboard.h! C'mon, angle brackets exist for a reason!
